# SpotifyAPI-NET

This Repository is a fork of JohnnyCrazy's [SpotifyAPI-NET](https://github.com/JohnnyCrazy/SpotifyAPI-NET). A fork was needed to add extra configuration options used by my [Classical Spotify Shuffler app](https://github.com/matthewslesinski/classicalSpotifyShuffler). For the main documentation, see the original forked repository.
